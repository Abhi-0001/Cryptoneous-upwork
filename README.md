<description>
  This is going to be a upwork kind of thingy but just to train models by selecting images and earn a little bit crypto using that. 
  Also for the social media creators to select most appropriate (most clickable thumbnail for their content) just by spending little amount of crypto.
  So web3 structure is also going to be used in it to hanlde payment structure.
